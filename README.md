# This repo shows demo of a clock component created using Web Components Specifications 

## The HTML Template specification

HTML templates allow you to add the HTML markup without rendering it.
JavaScript can access the HTML template markup and hence if we want to repeat the
markup without writing it again, we can do so with the help of JavaScript.

Look into [htmltemplateexample.html](./htmltemplateexample.html) file for more details.

## The Custom Elements specification

Custom elements teach the browser new tricks while preserving the benefits of HTML.

With Custom Elements, web developers can create new HTML tags extending current HTML tags and adding behaviour. You create reusable components using vanilla JS/HTML/CSS

This repo has a folder [clockcustomelement](./clockcustomelement) that shows how to create web components on browser

## The shadow DOM specification

Shadow DOM is a new DOM feature that helps you build components. You can think of shadow DOM as a scoped subtree inside your element.

Look into [shadowdomexample.html](./shadowdomexample.html) file for more details.

## ES6 Modules

As your JavaScript apps grow, it becomes necessary to break your Javascript code into folders with files having functions.

***export*** keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.

***import*** allows the import of functionality from other modules.

Refer [Javascript Info](https://javascript.info/modules) for more details
